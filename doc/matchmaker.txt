In addition to SDL2 and SDL2_net, you will need libjpeg-devel and libpng-devel.

You need the build essentials / development tools of course.

unixODBC and libgcrypt-devel are required to compile.



If you get the error:

./csmm: error while loading shared libraries: libSDL2-2.0.so.0: cannot open shar
ed object file: No such file or directory

The libs are in /usr/local/lib/ if you compiled from source. 
Copy libSDL2_net-2.0.so.0 and libSDL2-2.0.so.0 to /usr/lib64/
